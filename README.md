# Portfolio

This is the second iteration of my web portfolio. I started this project with the purpose of showcasing my work while practicing the frameworks I was learning at the time: **React** and **Next.js** (as well as derusting my TypeScript).

## Cool features 

- Responsive design
	Portfolio was created with smaller screen devices in mind. You can look at it comfortably from your phone, tablet or desktop computer!
- Dark and light mode
	Portfolio has native dark and light mode with customized color palettes.
- Transitions!
	Portfolio's UI provides feedback with little transitions and animations, making the app look smoother.
- Filters
	The projects page comes with a filters component (languages, frameworks, and database engines) to quickly get to what you're looking for.
- Image carousel
	Portfolio has a built-in image carousel for those projects with images to display.
- Next.js
	Portfolio was built with Next.js and it takes advantage of it! Image optimization, API routes, localization, and SEO.
- Localization
	One of the reasons I wanted to remake this project: localization. You can easily switch between Spanish and English with one click (or tap)!
