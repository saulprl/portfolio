Moody Notes allows the user to submit notes, and also attach up to 72 emotions to each one. The notes are then displayed on the main screen and the user can choose to sort by oldest, newest, and even filter the list by group of emotions. Lastly, Moody Notes includes a calendar which lets the user keep track of the notes submitted each day.",
